# Classic-AutoQuest

A minimalist auto quest acceptor/hand-in. Built to be lightweight and use minimal resources.

# Features
- Auto skip past dialog and accept quest(s)
- Auto hand in of one or more quests
- Auto accept a quest reward if there's only one reward provided
- Link quest rewards in chat window from a recently accepted quest
- Won't auto accept or complete a quest which requires gold from the player 

Currently being developed. Happy to create specific features if there's interest.
